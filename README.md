This project is to build a procurement system that manages the creation, approval, execution and tracking of purchase orders.     The system will allow employees that need to purchase items for work to submit a purchase order describing what they need and why.  
The order will first be routed to the employeeâ€™s manager to evaluate whether the order should be approved. If the order is approved, it is routed to a procurement officer who selects a vendor and purchases the item.  
The system collects data about the status of the purchase order including the cost of the items purchased, expected and actual delivery dates for the item and any defective items that are received. This data allows actors in the organization to track the status of orders, but also enables the aggregation of data across the whole organization such as overall spending and vendor performance that can be used to make the procurement process more efficient.
